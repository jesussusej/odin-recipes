            <h2>Easy Vegetarian Ravioli</h2>
            <p>This homemade ravioli is actually vegetarian, although no one who tries it can tell! The savory filling
                contains three
                different cheeses, mushrooms, and spinach. Although it's a rather time-consuming recipe to prepare, the
                results are well
                worth it!</p>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Whisk together 1 teaspoon olive oil, water, and whole eggs in a bowl until evenly blended; set
                    aside. Combine flour and
                    salt in a separate large bowl, and make a well in the center. Pour the egg mixture into the well and
                    stir just until
                    combined. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth, 5 to 10 minutes,
                    adding more flour or
                    water as needed. Wrap dough tightly with plastic wrap, and set aside to rest.</li>
                <li>Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the garlic and onion; cook and stir
                    until the onion
                    begins to soften, about 2 minutes. Add the mushrooms, and continue cooking and stirring until the
                    vegetables are soft
                    and the liquid has evaporated, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat, and allow to cool.</li>
                <li>Beat cream cheese in a bowl until smooth. Stir in the cooled mushroom mixture, Parmesan cheese,
                    mozzarella cheese,
                    spinach, 1 tablespoon chives, parsley, and cayenne pepper. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Roll the pasta dough out to about 1/16 inch thick. Cut 3 to 4-inch circles using a large cookie
                    cutter. Roll each circle
                    out as thin as possible. Working with one circle at a time, brush the pasta lightly with the egg
                    white. Scoop about 1
                    heaping tablespoon full of the mushroom filling onto the center of the pasta, then cover with a
                    second piece of pasta,
                    pinching the edges to seal. Cut the sealed ravioli with the cookie cutter once more to create a
                    uniform shape. Place the
                    finished ravioli on a floured baking sheet, and repeat the process with the remaining pasta and
                    filling.</li>
                <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the
                    water is boiling, stir
                    in the ravioli and return to a boil. Cook until the pasta floats to the top, 3 to 4 minutes; drain.
                </li>
                <li>To make sauce: Melt butter in a skillet over high heat, cooking and stirring until browned, 5 to 7
                    minutes. Stir in 1
                    1/2 teaspoons chives. Serve over hot ravioli.</li>
