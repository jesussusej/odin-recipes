            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a 1 1/2-quart casserole dish with cooking
                    spray.</li>
                <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna in the boiling water, stirring
                    occasionally, until
                    cooked through but firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
                <li>Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer.
                    Bring water to a
                    boil. Add spinach, cover, and steam until tender, 2 to 6 minutes. Drain spinach.</li>
                <li>Mix spinach, ricotta cheese, 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese, egg, nutmeg, basil, salt, and black pepper
                    in a bowl until
                    thoroughly combined.</li>
                <li>Spread 1/4 cup pasta sauce on the bottom of the prepared casserole dish; top with 3 lasagna noodles,
                    1/2 of the ricotta
                    mixture, and 1/4 cup pasta sauce. Repeat layers of 3 more noodles, 1/2 cup ricotta mixture, and 1/4
                    cup pasta sauce. End
                    with remaining 3 lasagna noodles and 1/4 cup pasta sauce. Sprinkle 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese and
                    Parmesan cheese on top.
                    Cover casserole with aluminum foil.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Uncover casserole and continue baking until lasagna is
                    bubbling and lightly
                    browned, about 25 more minutes. Let lasagna stand 5 minutes before serving.</li>
